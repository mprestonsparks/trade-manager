# Active Inference Trading System

## Overview

The Trade Manager implements a holistic trading decision system that uses Active Inference and Genetic Algorithms to optimize all aspects of trading for maximum risk-adjusted returns. Rather than treating portfolio management, risk management, and trade execution as separate systems, it uses AI/GA methodologies to jointly optimize all trading decisions.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Active Inference Framework

Active Inference is used as the core decision-making framework across all trading domains. The system maintains and updates beliefs about:

1. **Portfolio Management**
   - Optimal asset allocation
   - Position sizing
   - Portfolio diversification
   - Rebalancing timing and thresholds

2. **Risk Management**
   - Position-level risk parameters
   - Portfolio-level risk exposure
   - Stop loss and take profit levels
   - Risk-adjusted position sizing

3. **Trade Execution**
   - Entry and exit timing
   - Order types and parameters
   - Execution strategies
   - Market impact considerations

### Belief Updating Process

The system updates its beliefs through:
1. **Perception**: Processing market states and analysis from the market-analysis system
2. **Learning**: Updating beliefs based on trading outcomes and performance
3. **Adaptation**: Adjusting parameters across all domains based on market conditions

### Genetic Algorithm Optimization

The genetic algorithm component evolves optimal solutions across all trading domains simultaneously:

1. **Population**: Trading strategies that encode:
   - Portfolio allocation rules
   - Risk management parameters
   - Execution parameters

2. **Fitness Function**: Primarily based on risk-adjusted returns, considering:
   - Sharpe Ratio
   - Maximum Drawdown
   - Portfolio Turnover
   - Transaction Costs
   - Market Impact

3. **Evolution Process**:
   - Selection based on risk-adjusted performance
   - Crossover of successful strategies
   - Mutation for parameter exploration
   - Multi-generational optimization

## Implementation Details

### System State (`SystemState` class)
```python
@dataclass
class SystemState:
    portfolio_state: PortfolioState
    risk_metrics: RiskMetrics
    execution_state: ExecutionState
    market_state: MarketState  # From market-analysis system
    performance_metrics: PerformanceMetrics
```

### Action Generation

The system generates actions that jointly optimize across all domains:

1. **Portfolio Actions**
   - Asset allocation adjustments
   - Position size modifications
   - Rebalancing decisions

2. **Risk Management Actions**
   - Stop loss adjustments
   - Risk exposure modifications
   - Hedging decisions

3. **Execution Actions**
   - Order placement timing
   - Order type selection
   - Execution strategy parameters

### Optimization Process

1. **State Evaluation**
```python
def evaluate_system_state(self) -> SystemState:
    """Evaluate current state across all domains"""
    portfolio_state = self.get_portfolio_state()
    risk_metrics = self.calculate_risk_metrics()
    execution_state = self.get_execution_state()
    market_state = self.market_analyzer.get_current_state()
    performance = self.calculate_performance_metrics()
    return SystemState(portfolio_state, risk_metrics, 
                      execution_state, market_state, performance)
```

2. **Action Generation**
```python
def generate_actions(self) -> List[TradingAction]:
    """Generate optimized actions across all domains"""
    system_state = self.evaluate_system_state()
    population = self.initialize_action_population()
    
    for generation in range(self.config.num_generations):
        fitness_scores = [
            self.evaluate_risk_adjusted_returns(action, system_state)
            for action in population
        ]
        population = self.evolve_population(population, fitness_scores)
    
    return self.select_best_actions(population)
```

## Performance Metrics

The system optimizes for risk-adjusted returns using:

1. **Primary Metrics**
   - Sharpe Ratio
   - Sortino Ratio
   - Maximum Drawdown
   - Risk-adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC)

2. **Secondary Metrics**
   - Portfolio Turnover
   - Transaction Costs
   - Market Impact
   - Tracking Error

## Configuration

The system can be configured through:

1. **Optimization Parameters**
   - Learning rates
   - Population size
   - Generation count
   - Mutation rates

2. **Risk Parameters**
   - Maximum position sizes
   - Portfolio concentration limits
   - Value at Risk (VaR) limits
   - Maximum drawdown limits

3. **Execution Parameters**
   - Order size limits
   - Minimum time between trades
   - Maximum spread thresholds
   - Market impact thresholds

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize system
trade_manager = TradeManager(config)

# Process market updates
async def process_market_update(market_data):
    # Get market analysis
    analysis = market_analyzer.analyze(market_data)
    
    # Generate optimized actions
    actions = trade_manager.generate_actions(analysis)
    
    # Execute optimal actions
    for action in actions:
        await trade_manager.execute_action(action)
```

## Integration with Trade Engine

The Active Inference system is integrated into the trade engine:

```python
class TradeEngine:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.optimizer = ActiveInferenceOptimizer(config)
    
    async def process_market_signal(self, signal: MarketSignal) -> None:
        # Update market beliefs
        self.optimizer.update_beliefs({
            'symbol': signal.symbol,
            'price': signal.metadata.get('price', 0),
            'volume': signal.metadata.get('volume', 0),
            'timestamp': signal.timestamp,
            'volatility': signal.volatility,
            'market_data': signal.metadata.get('market_data', {})
        })
        
        # Generate and select optimal action
        possible_actions = self.optimizer.generate_actions()
        best_action = possible_actions[0]
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Belief updates are O(1)
   - Action generation is O(population_size * num_generations)
   - Memory usage is O(population_size)

2. **Optimization Parameters**
   - Larger population sizes and more generations improve optimization but increase computation time
   - Higher mutation rates increase exploration but may reduce convergence
   - Learning rate affects belief adaptation speed

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Start with conservative exploration factors (0.1-0.2)
   - Use moderate population sizes (100-200)
   - Keep mutation rates low (0.05-0.1)

2. **Market Regimes**
   - System adapts differently to various market conditions
   - Higher exploration in uncertain markets
   - More conservative in high volatility

3. **Risk Management**
   - Position sizes are optimized based on uncertainty
   - Stop losses adapt to market volatility
   - Take profits consider risk-reward ratios

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Belief Models**
   - Integration of more market indicators
   - Hierarchical belief structures
   - Long-term market regime memory

2. **Advanced Optimization**
   - Multi-objective genetic algorithms
   - Adaptive mutation rates
   - Parallel evolution strategies

3. **Risk Enhancement**
   - Portfolio-level optimization
   - Correlation-aware position sizing
   - Dynamic risk adjustment
