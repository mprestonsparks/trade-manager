# Active Inference Trading System

## Overview

The Trade Manager implements a sophisticated trading decision system that combines Active Inference with Genetic Algorithms to create an adaptive, self-optimizing trading engine. This document explains the theoretical foundation, implementation details, and practical usage of the system.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Active Inference

Active Inference is a theoretical framework that treats decision-making as a process of minimizing expected free energy. In our trading context, this means:

1. **Belief Updating**: The system maintains and updates beliefs about:
   - Market trends
   - Volatility levels
   - Momentum
   - Support/resistance levels
   - Market regimes

2. **Free Energy Minimization**: Trading decisions are made by minimizing two components:
   - Expected surprise (divergence between predicted and actual market states)
   - Information gain (reduction in uncertainty about market state)

### Genetic Algorithms

The system uses genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize trading actions:

1. **Population**: Set of possible trading actions
2. **Fitness**: Evaluated using free energy principles
3. **Evolution**: Actions are evolved through:
   - Tournament selection
   - Crossover between successful actions
   - Mutation for exploration
   - Multi-generational optimization

## Implementation Details

### Market Beliefs (`MarketBelief` class)

```python
@dataclass
class MarketBelief:
    trend_strength: float              # Range [-1, 1]
    volatility: float                  # Range [0, 1]
    momentum: float                    # Range [-1, 1]
    support_resistance: List[float]
    market_regime: str                 # "trending", "ranging", etc.
    confidence: float                  # Range [0, 1]
```

### Trading Actions (`TradingAction` class)

```python
@dataclass
class TradingAction:
    action_type: str                 # "enter_long", "enter_short", etc.
    size: Decimal                    # Position size
    entry_price: Optional[Decimal]
    stop_loss: Optional[Decimal]
    take_profit: Optional[Decimal]
    expected_reward: float           # Expected profit/loss
    uncertainty: float               # Uncertainty in reward

### Active Inference Process

1. **Belief Updating**
   ```python
   def update_beliefs(self, market_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
       # Extract market features
       trend = self._calculate_trend(market_data)
       vol = self._calculate_volatility(market_data)
       mom = self._calculate_momentum(market_data)
       
       # Update beliefs using precision-weighted prediction errors
       prediction_error = {
           'trend': trend - self.market_belief.trend_strength,
           'volatility': vol - self.market_belief.volatility,
           'momentum': mom - self.market_belief.momentum
       }
   ```

2. **Action Generation**
   ```python
   def generate_actions(self) -> List[TradingAction]:
       # Generate initial population
       population = self._initialize_action_population()
       
       # Evolve through multiple generations
       for generation in range(self.config.get("num_generations", 10)):
           fitness_scores = [self._evaluate_action_fitness(action) 
                           for action in population]
           parents = self._select_parents(population, fitness_scores)
           population = self._evolve_population(parents)
   ```

### Genetic Algorithm Components

1. **Fitness Evaluation**
   ```python
   def _evaluate_action_fitness(self, action: TradingAction) -> float:
       # Calculate expected reward component
       expected_reward = self._calculate_expected_reward(action)
       
       # Calculate information gain component
       information_gain = self._calculate_information_gain(action)
       
       # Combine using precision-weighted sum
       precision = 1.0 / (action.uncertainty + 1e-6)
       free_energy = precision * expected_reward + 
                    self.exploration_factor * information_gain
   ```

2. **Evolution Process**
   - Tournament Selection: Select best actions for reproduction
   - Crossover: Combine attributes of successful actions
   - Mutation: Random variations to explore action space

## Configuration

The system can be configured through several parameters:

```python
config = {
    "learning_rate": 0.01,        # Rate of belief updating
    "exploration_factor": 0.1,    # Weight of information gain
    "num_generations": 10,        # Generations per optimization
    "population_size": 100,       # Number of actions per generation
    "tournament_size": 5,         # Parents selected per tournament
    "mutation_rate": 0.1          # Probability of mutation
}
```

## Integration with Trade Engine

The Active Inference system is integrated into the trade engine:

```python
class TradeEngine:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.optimizer = ActiveInferenceOptimizer(config)
    
    async def process_market_signal(self, signal: MarketSignal) -> None:
        # Update market beliefs
        self.optimizer.update_beliefs({
            'symbol': signal.symbol,
            'price': signal.metadata.get('price', 0),
            'volume': signal.metadata.get('volume', 0),
            'timestamp': signal.timestamp,
            'volatility': signal.volatility,
            'market_data': signal.metadata.get('market_data', {})
        })
        
        # Generate and select optimal action
        possible_actions = self.optimizer.generate_actions()
        best_action = possible_actions[0]
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Computational Efficiency**
   - Belief updates are O(1)
   - Action generation is O(population_size * num_generations)
   - Memory usage is O(population_size)

2. **Optimization Parameters**
   - Larger population sizes and more generations improve optimization but increase computation time
   - Higher mutation rates increase exploration but may reduce convergence
   - Learning rate affects belief adaptation speed

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Start with conservative exploration factors (0.1-0.2)
   - Use moderate population sizes (100-200)
   - Keep mutation rates low (0.05-0.1)

2. **Market Regimes**
   - System adapts differently to various market conditions
   - Higher exploration in uncertain markets
   - More conservative in high volatility

3. **Risk Management**
   - Position sizes are optimized based on uncertainty
   - Stop losses adapt to market volatility
   - Take profits consider risk-reward ratios

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Belief Models**
   - Integration of more market indicators
   - Hierarchical belief structures
   - Long-term market regime memory

2. **Advanced Optimization**
   - Multi-objective genetic algorithms
   - Adaptive mutation rates
   - Parallel evolution strategies

3. **Risk Enhancement**
   - Portfolio-level optimization
   - Correlation-aware position sizing
   - Dynamic risk adjustment
