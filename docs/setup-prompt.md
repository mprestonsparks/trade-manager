# Trade Manager Development Specification

## Overview

The Trade Manager is a critical component of our trading system, responsible for executing and managing trades based on signals from our Market Analysis API. This document provides comprehensive instructions for developing the Trade Manager system, following established architectural patterns and integration requirements.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Trade Management Engine**
   - Manages the lifecycle of trades from signal receipt through execution and monitoring
   - Implements the Active Inference methodology for trade decision optimization
   - Integrates with the Market Analysis API for real-time signal processing
   - Handles portfolio allocation and risk management

2. **Strategy Execution Module**
   - Converts market analysis signals into executable trading decisions
   - Implements position sizing and entry/exit logic
   - Manages strategy-specific parameters and configurations
   - Handles multiple concurrent strategies across different market states

3. **Risk Management System**
   - Implements dynamic risk controls based on market states
   - Manages position sizing and leverage limits
   - Monitors and enforces stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Provides real-time risk metrics and exposure analysis

4. **Portfolio Manager**
   - Maintains overall portfolio state and composition
   - Implements dynamic capital allocation
   - Manages strategy weights and rebalancing
   - Tracks performance metrics and generates reports

5. **Market Analysis API Integration**
   - Handles real-time communication with the Market Analysis API
   - Processes and validates incoming market state data and signals
   - Implements rate limiting and error handling
   - Manages data synchronization and caching

#### Core Classes and Interfaces

1. **TradeEngine**
```python
class TradeEngine:
    """
    Primary trade management system coordinating all trading operations.
    Implements Active Inference methodology for trade optimization.
    """
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Initialize trade engine with configuration parameters.
        
        Args:
            config: Configuration dictionary containing:
                - API endpoints
                - Risk parameters
                - Strategy settings
                - Portfolio limits
        """
        pass

    async def process_market_signal(self, signal: MarketSignal) -> None:
        """
        Process incoming market signals and determine appropriate actions.
        
        Args:
            signal: Market signal containing state and trade recommendations
        """
        pass

    async def execute_trade(self, trade: Trade) -> TradeResult:
        """
        Execute a trade based on validated signals and risk parameters.
        
        Args:
            trade: Trade object containing execution details
            
        Returns:
            TradeResult containing execution status and details
        """
        pass
```

2. **PortfolioManager**
```python
class PortfolioManager:
    """
    Manages portfolio composition and strategy allocation.
    """
    def update_allocation(self, market_state: MarketState) -> None:
        """
        Update portfolio allocation based on current market state.
        
        Args:
            market_state: Current market state from analysis API
        """
        pass

    def calculate_position_size(self, signal: TradeSignal) -> Decimal:
        """
        Calculate position size based on portfolio value and risk parameters.
        
        Args:
            signal: Trade signal with confidence metrics
            
        Returns:
            Position size in base currency
