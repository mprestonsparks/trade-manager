# Airflow Integration Implementation Plan for Trade Manager

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-17

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating the Trade Manager system with the centralized Airflow orchestration system (`airflow-hub`). The integration approach is designed to maintain alignment with the project's advanced portfolio management, risk control, and automation goals, while supporting robust, modular workflows.

---

## Project Goals (from Documentation)
- Provide a sophisticated trading system using Active Inference and Genetic Algorithms for optimal trade execution and portfolio management.
- Maintain modular, extensible code for risk management, portfolio allocation, and trade execution.
- Enable robust system state management, broker integration, and dynamic strategy optimization.
- Support automated, scheduled, and event-driven workflows.

## Airflow Integration Requirements
- **Identify management/execution/reporting functions** suitable for Airflow orchestration (e.g., scheduled portfolio rebalancing, risk audits, trade execution, performance reporting).
- **Refactor or modularize code** to ensure all Airflow tasks are importable/callable (avoid monolithic scripts).
- **Define DAGs** in `airflow-hub/dags/trade-manager/` that reference these callable functions or API endpoints.
- **Manage dependencies** via `airflow-hub/requirements.txt` or containerized tasks as needed.
- **Handle secrets/config** using Airflow connections and variables (never hardcoded).
- **Testing:**
  - Local unit tests remain in this repo.
  - DAG validation and integration tests live in `airflow-hub`.
- **Documentation:**
  - Maintain up-to-date integration docs in both repos.
  - Clearly document required Airflow connection IDs, variables, and expected DAG outputs.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Audit Existing Code**
   - Catalog all management, execution, and reporting functions relevant for Airflow orchestration.
   - Note any incomplete or placeholder code.
2. **Refactor for Modularity**
   - Split monolithic scripts into callable functions/classes.
   - Ensure all business logic to be orchestrated is importable by Airflow.
3. **Task Identification & Design**
   - Define which operations should be triggered by Airflow (e.g., scheduled rebalancing, risk audits, trade execution workflows).
   - Design function signatures and outputs for Airflow compatibility.
4. **DAG Development**
   - Collaborate with `airflow-hub` to create/maintain DAGs in `dags/trade-manager/`.
   - Follow naming conventions and modular structure as per `airflow-hub` integration guide.
5. **Dependency & Secrets Management**
   - List all required external libraries for Airflow tasks.
   - If dependency conflicts arise, prefer containerized Airflow tasks over modifying the shared environment.
   - Document and configure Airflow connections/variables (e.g., `trade_manager_broker_conn`).
6. **Testing & Validation**
   - Write/maintain local unit tests for all Airflow-tasked functions.
   - Ensure DAGs are covered by validation/integration tests in `airflow-hub`.
7. **Documentation & Verification**
   - Update this plan and integration guides as changes are made.
   - Provide clear mapping of Airflow DAGs to underlying functions/scripts.
   - Maintain a checklist for alignment with requirements/goals.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All Airflow tasks are modular, callable, and documented.
- [ ] DAGs in `airflow-hub` reference only importable code from this repo.
- [ ] All dependencies and secrets are managed via Airflow best practices.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests cover all Airflow-integrated functionality.
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date and clearly describes the integration.
- [ ] Implementation aligns with both the project and Airflow monorepo goals.
